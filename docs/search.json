    "text": "Background\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, with devastating impacts on infrastructure and communities. In February 2021, Texas experienced a major power crisis resulting from three severe winter storms that swept across the United States between February 10-20, leaving millions without power for days in freezing temperatures1. The storm brought record-breaking cold and extreme weather conditions that overwhelmed the state’s power infrastructure. As temperatures decreased, demand for electricity surged while nearly half the grid’s generating capacity failed 2.\nIn this blog post, I identify the impacts of this series of extreme winter storms by estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power and investigate whether these impacts were disproportionately felt by low-income populations. Understanding where and who the blackout affected is important to determine infrastructure vulnerabilities and environmental justice concerns for future extreme weather events as well as recovery from the storm."

    "text": "Analysis\nTo investigate the impact of the February 2021 winter storms on Houston, I analyzed satellite imagery and socioeconomic data through three main steps: identifying blackout locations, estimating affected homes, and examining socioeconomic patterns.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Blackout Locations\nI began by comparing nighttime light intensity before and after the storm using NASA’s satellite data.\nLoad Packages and Import the datasets\n\n\nCode\n# Load libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(raster) \nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\n# Read raster tiles for both dates\nrt_0705 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\",\n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\nrt_0706 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\nrt_1605 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\nrt_1606 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n\n# Read roads data\nroads &lt;- st_read(here(\"data\",\n       \"gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\") %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Read building data\nbuildings &lt;- st_read(here(\"data\",\n                          \"gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \" SELECT *\n    FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1\n    WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)\n      OR type IN ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', \n  'detached')\")\n\n# Read the layers holding the Texas geometry information\ntexas_geom &lt;- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\n\ntexas_income &lt;- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                         layer = \"X19_INCOME\",\n                         query = \"SELECT B19013e1, GEOID FROM X19_INCOME\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(GEOID_Data = GEOID)\n\n\n\nVisualization of Night Light Changes\nMaps comparing night light intensities before and after the storms\n\n\nCode\n# Merge tiles from February 7, 2021\nmosaic_7 &lt;- st_mosaic(rt_0705, rt_0706)\n# Merge tiles from February 16, 2021\nmosaic_16 &lt;- st_mosaic(rt_1605, rt_1606)\n\n# Create color palette for the night lights\npal_lights &lt;- c(\"#000011\", \"#000066\", \"#2222AA\", \"#FFFF66\", \"#FFFFFF\")\n\n# Plot raster of night lights before the storms\nmap_before &lt;- tm_shape(mosaic_7) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 07, 2021 (Before storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules()+\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\n# Plot raster of night lights after the storms\nmap_after &lt;- tm_shape(mosaic_16) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 16, 2021 (After storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\ntmap_arrange(map_before, map_after, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maps above show a side-by-side comparison of before and after the winter storm’s impact on Texas’s power infrastructure. Before the storm (February 7), the nighttime lights show dense and continuous illumination across major metropolitan areas. The yellow and white areas indicate high light intensity, representing normal electricity usage in urban centers.\nAfter the storm (February 16), there is a significant reduction in light intensity across the raster tile, with previously bright yellow regions now appearing in darker blue tones, confirming widespread power outages affecting residents.\nNotably, the spatial pattern suggests that blackouts were not uniformly distributed. This heterogeneous distribution of impacts makes it worthy of investigating whether certain communities were disproportionately affected by the power crisis.\nTo isolate areas that truly experienced blackouts, I calculated the change in light intensity between these dates. Areas showing a drop greater than 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ were classified as experiencing blackout.\nCalculate light intensity difference\n\n\nCode\n# Subtract light intensity (February 7 - February 16)\ndifference &lt;- mosaic_7 - mosaic_16\n\n#  keep only locations with light drops &gt; 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹\nlights_mask_diff &lt;- difference\nlights_mask_diff[difference &lt; 200] &lt;- NA\n\n# Vectorize mask and ensure valid geometry\nmask_vec &lt;- st_as_sf(lights_mask_diff, as_points = FALSE, merge = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  st_make_valid() %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf(crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Estimating the Number of Affected Homes in Houston\nI then focused the analysis on the Houston metropolitan area and excluded highways, which typically remain lit even during residential blackouts, to ensure the results reflected actual residential impacts.\nTo narrow the analysis to the Houston metropolitan region, I defined a bounding box encompassing the Houston area.\n\n\nCode\n# Define coordinates of Houston\nlon &lt;- c(-96.5, -96.5, -94.5, -94.5)\nlat &lt;- c(29, 30.5, 30.5, 29)\n\n# Create bbox from min and max of lon and lat\nhouston_bbox &lt;- st_bbox(c(\n  xmin = min(lon),\n  ymin = min(lat),\n  xmax = max(lon),\n  ymax = max(lat)), crs = st_crs(mask_vec))\n\n# Crop the blackout mask to the Houston bounding box\ncropped_blackout &lt;-  st_crop(mask_vec, houston_bbox) %&gt;% \nst_make_valid() %&gt;% \n  st_transform(cropped_blackout, crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n\nTo isolate residential blackout areas, I created a 200-meter buffer around all highways and removed these areas from the blackout mask. This step ensures that the analysis captures only areas where residential communities experienced power loss.\n\n\nCode\n# create a 200m buffer around highways and dissolve overlapping areas\nroads_buffer &lt;- st_buffer(roads, dist = 200) %&gt;% \nst_union\n\n# Check if the datasets have the same coordinate reference system.\n# If not, print a warning and transform the second dataset to match the first.\nif(st_crs(cropped_blackout) != st_crs(roads_buffer)){\n  warning(\"coordinate reference systems do not match\")\n  roads_buffer &lt;- st_transform(roads_buffer, crs = st_crs(cropped_blackout))}\n\n\nWith highways excluded, I identified the residential areas that experienced blackouts by subtracting the highway buffers from the blackout mask. I then spatially intersected the blackout layer with the building data to identify individual homes that lost power during the storm.\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure the blackout layer has valid geometries\ncropped_blackout &lt;- st_make_valid(cropped_blackout)\n\n# Ensure the roads buffer layer has valid geometries\nroads_buffer &lt;- st_make_valid(roads_buffer)\n\n# Subtract the roads buffer from the blackout\nblackout_not_road &lt;- st_difference(cropped_blackout, roads_buffer)\n\n# Check if the datasets have the same coordinate reference system.\n# If not, print a warning and transform the second dataset to match the first.\nif(st_crs(blackout_not_road) != st_crs(buildings)){\n  warning(\"coordinate reference systems do not match\")\n  buildings &lt;- st_transform(buildings, crs = st_crs(blackout_not_road))}\n\n# Select homes that overlap with blackout_not_road.\nhomes_blackout &lt;- buildings[blackout_not_road, \n                     op = st_intersects, \n                     drop = FALSE] \n\n\n\nMap of Homes Affected by the Blackout\nThe following map displays the individual residential buildings that lost power during the storm. Each purple polygon represents a home identified through the spatial intersection of building footprints (from OpenStreetMap) with the blackout zones. This allows us to see which structures were affected, rather than just showing general blackout areas.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot a map of homes affected by the blackout\nmap_homes_blackout &lt;- tm_shape(homes_blackout) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"#480091\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Homes in Houston that lost power\") +\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_basemap(\"OpenStreetMap\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.1),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE) +\n  tm_add_legend(type = \"fill\",\n                labels = \"Homes Affected\",\n                col = \"#480091\",\n                title = \"Legend\")\n\nmap_homes_blackout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows the spatial distribution of affected homes, with a notable concentration in central Houston. This visualization helps us understand not just how many homes were impacted, but where the impacts were most severe.\nUsing building data from OpenStreetMap, I identified residential structures within the blackout zones. The analysis revealed that approximately 157,970 homes lost power during the storm.\n\n\nCode\n# Count the number of homes that lost power\nlength(homes_blackout$fclass)\n\n\n[1] 157970\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Exploring Socioeconomic Patterns\nI wanted to investigate whether the blackouts disproportionately affected lower-income communities. To explore this, I overlaid the blackout data with census tract information, examining median household income across affected and unaffected areas.\nPrepare median income data\n\n\nCode\n# Left join geometry and median income layers\ninc_geom &lt;- left_join(texas_geom, texas_income, by = \"GEOID_Data\") %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Transform CRS\nhouston_bbox &lt;- houston_bbox %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Crop income layer to the Houston bounding box\nhouston_income &lt;- st_crop(inc_geom, houston_bbox) %&gt;% \nst_make_valid() %&gt;% \n  st_transform(houston_income, crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n\n\nMap of the census tracts in Houston that lost power\nTo understand the socioeconomic characteristics of communities impacted by the power outage, I map the median household income for census tracts containing homes that experienced blackouts.\n\n\nCode\n# Verify that both datasets use the same CRS and add a stop error if they don't\nif(st_crs(houston_income) != st_crs(homes_blackout)){\n    stop(\"coordinate reference systems must match to join datasets\")}\n\n# Intersect census tracts with blackout areas\nhomes_census_blackout &lt;- houston_income[homes_blackout,\n                               op = st_intersects]\n\n# Create map showing median income for blackout-affected census tracts\ntm_shape(homes_census_blackout) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"B19013e1\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",              \n    title = \"Median Income by census tract (dollars)\") + \n tm_basemap(server = \"OpenStreetMap\", alpha = 0.7) +\n tm_graticules() +\n tm_title(text = \"Median Income by Census Tract for Houses\n          Affected by the Blackout in Houston\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map reveals the spatial distribution of median household income across census tracts affected by the blackout. The darker red areas indicate higher-income neighborhoods, while lighter shades represent lower-income areas.\nTo quantify whether income played a role in blackout vulnerability, I compared all Houston census tracts, categorizing them by whether they experienced blackouts or not.\nFind census tracts that did not experience blackout\n\n\nCode\n# Compare all Houston tracts against those identified with blackouts,\n# Remove geometry and select only income and status variables\ncensus_combined &lt;- houston_income %&gt;%\n  mutate(blackout_status = if_else(GEOID_Data %in% homes_census_blackout$GEOID_Data, \n                                   \"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(B19013e1, blackout_status) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\nTo examine whether the blackout disproportionately impacted certain socioeconomic groups, I visualized the distribution of median household income across census tracts in the Houston area and compared the income profiles of affected versus unaffected communities.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot income distribution by blackout status\nggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(data = census_combined,\n           aes(x = blackout_status, \n               y = B19013e1,\n               fill = blackout_status)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c(\"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#2955AA\", \"#F9cF66\"),\n                    name = \"Blackout Status\") +\n  labs(x = \"Affected Status\",\n       y = \"Median Income of Census Tract (dollars)\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Median Income in Areas Affected \n       and Unaffected by Blackout in Houston\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot reveals similar income distributions between areas that experienced blackouts and those that did not. Unexpectedly, the yellow box representing unaffected areas shows a slightly lower median income compared to the blue box representing blackout-affected census tracts. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that lower-income communities were disproportionately impacted by the power outages."

    "text": "Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe results show that median household incomes are similar between census tracts that experienced blackouts and those that did not, suggesting that income level was not a strong factor in determining which areas lost power during the storm. However, we need to consider some limitations of this result, as they relate to the spatial scale and join methods used in our analysis. Some possible bias in the results may be related to the concentration of buildings in the central part of Houston affected by blackouts, as shown in the Homes Map, and the reliance on tract-level overlaps that generalize patterns and hide smaller spatial or demographic variations.\nFuture research should employ finer spatial resolution (e.g., block group or individual building level) and could incorporate additional socioeconomic variables beyond income, including housing age, renter vs. owner occupancy, and racial demographics."

To understand which affected areas face greater challenges during and after the fires, we visualize the EJI Indicator: Social Vulnerability, age 65 and older data for census tracts within both fire perimeters.\nIn this analysis, we focus on the population aged 65 and older (E_AGE65). Older adults often face increased health risks from smoke exposure, have greater difficulty evacuating, and may experience longer recovery times after disasters. By comparing the spatial distribution of this demographic across the Palisades and Eaton fire areas, we can identify which communities may require additional support and resources.\nWe create side-by-side maps showing the percentage of residents aged 65 and older in census tracts intersecting each fire perimeter, revealing whether one fire disproportionately affected communities with higher concentrations of vulnerable older residents.\n\n\nCode\n# Create blank figure with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(30, 20))\n\n# Specify the EJI variable to plot\neji_variable = 'E_AGE65'\n\n# Find common min/max for legend range\nvmin = min(eji_pali[eji_variable].min(), eji_eaton[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(eji_pali[eji_variable].max(), eji_eaton[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter\neji_pali.plot(\n    column= eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax1,\n)\nax1.set_title('Palisades Perimeter', fontsize=38)\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter\neji_eaton.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax2,\n)\nax2.set_title('Eaton Perimeter', fontsize=38)\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Add title\nfig.suptitle('Population Aged 65 and Older - Fire Areas Comparison',\n             fontsize=40, fontweight='bold', y=0.78)\n\n# Add shared colorbar at the bottom\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable( norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax))\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.2, 0.5, 0.02])\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Population Aged 65 and Older (percentage)', fontsize=38)\ncbar.ax.tick_params(labelsize=32)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Interpretation\nThe variable Population Aged 65 and Older (E_AGE65) shows a different distribution across the two fire perimeters. In the Palisades fire perimeter, there is a higher concentration of census tracts with elevated percentage of elderly residents compared to the Eaton fire perimeter. This suggests that the Palisades area have a larger proportion of older adults who could face greater challenges during wildfire events, such as mobility issues and health vulnerabilities. Consequently, wildfire relief efforts in the Palisades area may need to prioritize resources for evacuation assistance, medical support, and community outreach tailored to the needs of elderly residents. In contrast, the Eaton fire perimeter may require different strategies focused on other demographic factors present in that area."

    "section": "The Case:",
    "text": "The Case:\n\nEffects of geographical data sampling bias on habitat models of species distributions: a case study with steppe birds in southern Portugal\n\nThe Data and the Problem\nBetween March and June 2004, researchers led by Pedro Leitão surveyed 560 sites across the Baixo Alentejo region of southern Portugal, documenting nine species of steppe birds including the Great Bustard, Stone Curlew, and Calandra Lark. The researchers designed their sampling scheme carefully using stratified random sampling across the entire region to ensure balanced, unbiased coverage of different habitat types and geographical areas.\nAfter collecting this baseline dataset, considered to be as complete and unbiased as practically possible, the research team deliberately degraded their own data. They created multiple subsampled datasets that mimicked common real-world sampling biases, removing 80-90% of observations in patterns that reflected how field surveys typically occur. Some subsamples concentrated observations near road networks, and others near protected areas. These artificially biased datasets became experiments to test how geographical sampling bias affects the habitat models of species distributions\n\n\nIdentifying the Bias\nThe type of bias examined in this study is geographical sampling bias, specifically spatial clustering of observation points. This occurs when data collection is systematically concentrated in certain geographical areas while other areas remain undersampled. The researchers identified this bias through spatial analysis of their deliberately subsampled datasets, measuring both the spatial distribution of sampling points and the representation of environmental conditions in each biased dataset compared to the comprehensive baseline.\nWhen observations clustered near roads or protected areas, the resulting datasets failed to adequately represent the full range of environmental conditions present across the landscape. Agricultural areas far from roads, certain elevation ranges, and specific vegetation types became severely underrepresented.\n\n\nThe Consequences\nWhen the team built habitat suitability models using these biased datasets, the predictions diverged considerably from those based on unbiased data. Road-biased models predicted high suitability in easily accessible areas while systematically underestimating habitat quality in remote locations. Protected area-biased models overemphasized characteristics found within reserves while missing important habitats elsewhere. These shifts in predicted bird occurrence patterns were substantial, yet the biased models often appeared statistically adequate, creating false confidence in fundamentally flawed results that would lead conservation efforts to prioritize the wrong areas for protection."

    "title": "Where We Look Determines What We Find: How Sampling Bias Threatens Steppe Bird Conservation",
    "section": "Reflection",
    "text": "Reflection\nThis case study shows a troubling pattern in environmental science: our data often reflects where we can easily collect observations rather than where observations should be collected to answer our questions. The Portugal steppe birds study demonstrates a form of selection bias, specifically, a bias arising from the process of selecting sampling locations based on convenience rather than representative coverage. As Frampton et al. (2022) and Konno et al. (2023) explain, selection biases occur when the way we choose what to measure systematically excludes certain populations or conditions. In this case, road-biased and protected area-biased sampling created datasets that fundamentally misrepresented the environmental conditions across the landscape.\nWhat makes geographical sampling bias particularly challenging is its invisibility. A biased dataset can look complete if you don’t consider where observations are missing, the data can still produce models that are internally consistent and statistically well-behaved, while being systematically inaccurate because the underlying sample misrepresents the true population. This reflects what Olteanu et al. (2019) describe as the “population bias” inherent in many data collection efforts. Though they refer to social data contexts, it can be translated to environmental data, where the sampled population differs systematically from the target population we aim to understand. The steppe bird biased models achieved good fits to their training data, but predicted occurrence patterns that diverged from reality in unsampled areas.\nThis case also raises questions about the political economy of scientific data collection and what Vera et al. (2019) term “extractive logic” in environmental data practices. Research funding, accessibility constraints, and institutional priorities shape where sampling occurs, often disconnecting data from the communities and landscapes most affected by conservation decisions. Similar patterns of geographic sampling bias have been documented in urban contexts, where Ellis-Soto et al. (2023) found that historically redlined neighborhoods in U.S. cities remain significantly undersampled for bird biodiversity data, demonstrating how structural inequities perpetuate sampling disparities across both rural and urban landscapes, where sites frequently sampled by citizen-science efforts may be in areas of low environmental justice concern. These patterns are rational responses to practical constraints, but they systematically bias our collective knowledge about biodiversity patterns while privileging certain voices and perspectives in conservation science.\nThis connects directly to principles of environmental data justice, which calls for data practices that are participatory, transparent, and accountable to affected communities rather than extractive and disconnected from context (Vera et al., 2019). In the case of steppe bird conservation, the communities who live in and depend on these landscapes, particularly those in remote areas far from roads and research stations, are rendered invisible by sampling bias, their environments mischaracterized in the very models meant to protect shared biodiversity."

    "section": "Solutions:",
    "text": "Solutions:\nSome complementary approaches for addressing geographical sampling bias include:\n\nImproved Sampling Design\nThe most direct solution is better sampling design from the beginning. Stratified random sampling, as used in the baseline Portugal dataset, ensures balanced coverage across geographical space and environmental gradients. While true random sampling is the gold standard, it is often impractical given access constraints and resource limitations, so researchers can implement sampling schemes that deliberately counteract predictable biases.\n\n\nBias Characterization\nWhen working with existing datasets, characterizing the nature and extent of bias becomes critical. The Portugal researchers demonstrated that quantifying environmental bias, provides insight into how much the data might mislead model predictions. Tools like environmental space analysis can reveal whether sampling adequately covers the range of conditions relevant to the species.\n\n\nTransparency and Uncertainty Communication\nOne solution that works universally is the acknowledgment of sampling bias and its implications. When habitat models inform conservation decisions, transparent communication about data limitations should accompany predictions. Maps of sampling effort overlaid with prediction maps would show decision-makers where predictions are well-supported by data versus where they represent extrapolation from biased samples. Uncertainty estimates that account for sampling bias could guide risk-averse conservation strategies that hedge against model uncertainty."

    "section": "Applicability to Other Cases",
    "text": "Applicability to Other Cases\nThese solutions can be applied across other environmental science contexts where spatial data guides decisions. Climate monitoring networks face similar biases, with weather stations concentrated in accessible, populated areas. Pollution monitoring suffers from systematic undersampling of disadvantaged communities, and biodiversity databases like GBIF and eBird contain multiple occurrence records with severe spatial bias toward well-studied regions, parks, and roadsides (Ellis-Soto et al., 2023).\nThe sampling design solutions are universally relevant, as stratified approaches can improve data quality in many geographic contexts, as well as bias characterization. The emphasis on transparency and uncertainty communication should become standard practice whenever spatial data informs high-stakes decisions. However, the specific techniques require adaptation to each context. The analysis that revealed bias in bird habitat data, by examining whether sampling captured the full range of environmental conditions, might translate poorly to pollution monitoring, where the relevant environmental factors look different."
