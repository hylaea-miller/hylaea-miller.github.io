    "text": "Background\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, with devastating impacts on infrastructure and communities. In February 2021, Texas experienced a major power crisis resulting from three severe winter storms that swept across the United States between February 10-20, leaving millions without power for days in freezing temperatures1.\nIn this blog post, I identify the impacts of these series of extreme winter storms by estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power and investigate whether these impacts were disproportionately felt by low-income populations."

    "text": "Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe results show that median household incomes are similar between census tracts that experienced blackouts and those that did not, suggesting that income level was not a strong factor in determining which areas lost power during the storm. However, we need to consider some limitations of this result, as they relate to the spatial scale and join methods used in our analysis. Some possible bias in the results may be related to the concentration of buildings in the central part of Houston affected by blackouts, as shown in the Homes Map, and the reliance on tract-level overlaps that generalize patterns and hide smaller spatial or demographic variations.\nFuture research should employ finer spatial resolution (e.g., block group or individual building level) and could incorporate additional socioeconomic variables beyond income, including housing age, renter vs. owner occupancy, and racial demographics."

The imagery was acquired by Landsat 8 on February 23, 2025.\nHealthy vegetation appears in shades of bright green due to high reflectance in the near-infrared band, while burned areas are shown in shades of brown and magenta, indicating low reflectance in both the shortwave infrared and near-infrared bands. Fire perimeters are overlaid on the image, with the Palisades Fire outlined in blue and the Eaton Fire outlined in red, allowing for easy identification of the affected areas."

In the Palisades fire perimeter, there is a higher concentration of census tracts with elevated percentiles of elderly residents compared to the Eaton fire perimeter. This suggests that the Palisades area have a larger proportion of older adults who could face greater challenges during wildfire events, such as mobility issues and health vulnerabilities. Consequently, wildfire relief efforts in the Palisades area may need to prioritize resources for evacuation assistance, medical support, and community outreach tailored to the needs of elderly residents. In contrast, the Eaton fire perimeter may require different strategies focused on other demographic factors present in that area.\n\nReferences:\nMicrosoft Planetary Computer. (2025).

    "text": "Analysis\nTo investigate the impact of the February 2021 winter storms on Houston, I analyzed satellite imagery and socioeconomic data through three main steps: identifying blackout locations, estimating affected homes, and examining socioeconomic patterns.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Blackout Locations\nI began by comparing nighttime light intensity before and after the storm using NASA’s satellite data.\nLoad Packages and Import the datasets\n\n\nCode\n# Load libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(raster) \nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\n# Read raster tiles for both dates\nrt_0705 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\",\n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\nrt_0706 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\nrt_1605 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\nrt_1606 &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n\n# Read roads data\nroads &lt;- st_read(here(\"data\",\n       \"gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\") %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Read building data\nbuildings &lt;- st_read(here(\"data\",\n                          \"gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \" SELECT *\n    FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1\n    WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)\n      OR type IN ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', \n  'detached')\")\n\n# Read the layers holding the Texas geometry information\ntexas_geom &lt;- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\n\ntexas_income &lt;- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                         layer = \"X19_INCOME\",\n                         query = \"SELECT B19013e1, GEOID FROM X19_INCOME\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(GEOID_Data = GEOID)\n\n\n\nVisualization of Night Light Changes\nMaps comparing night light intensities before and after the storms\n\n\nCode\n# Merge tiles from February 7, 2021\nmosaic_7 &lt;- st_mosaic(rt_0705, rt_0706)\n# Merge tiles from February 16, 2021\nmosaic_16 &lt;- st_mosaic(rt_1605, rt_1606)\n\n# Create color palette for the night lights\npal_lights &lt;- c(\"#000011\", \"#000066\", \"#2222AA\", \"#FFFF66\", \"#FFFFFF\")\n\n# Plot raster of night lights before the storms\nmap_before &lt;- tm_shape(mosaic_7) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 07, 2021 (Before storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules()+\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\n# Plot raster of night lights after the storms\nmap_after &lt;- tm_shape(mosaic_16) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 16, 2021 (After storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\ntmap_arrange(map_before, map_after, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo isolate areas that truly experienced blackouts, I calculated the change in light intensity between these dates.

This visualization helps us understand not just how many homes were impacted, but where the impacts were most severe.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Estimating number of Affected Homes\nUsing building data from OpenStreetMap, I identified residential structures within the blackout zones. The analysis revealed that approximately 157,970 homes lost power during the storm.\n\n\nCode\n# Count the number of homes that lost power\nlength(homes_blackout$fclass)\n\n\n[1] 157970\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Exploring Socioeconomic Patterns\nI wanted to investigate whether the blackouts disproportionately affected lower-income communities. To explore this, I overlaid the blackout data with census tract information, examining median household income across affected and unaffected areas.\nPrepare median income data\n\n\nCode\n# Left join geometry and median income layers\ninc_geom &lt;- left_join(texas_geom, texas_income, by = \"GEOID_Data\") %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Transform CRS\nhouston_bbox &lt;- houston_bbox %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Crop income layer to the Houston bounding box\nhouston_income &lt;- st_crop(inc_geom, houston_bbox) %&gt;% \nst_make_valid() %&gt;% \n  st_transform(houston_income, crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n\nMap of the census tracts in Houston that lost power\n\n\nCode\n# Verify that both datasets use the same CRS and add a stop error if they don't\nif(st_crs(houston_income) != st_crs(homes_blackout)){\n    stop(\"coordinate reference systems must match to join datasets\")}\n\n# Intersect census tracts with blackout areas\nhomes_census_blackout &lt;- houston_income[homes_blackout,\n                               op = st_intersects]\n\n# Create map showing median income for blackout-affected census tracts\ntm_shape(homes_census_blackout) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"B19013e1\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",              \n    title = \"Median Income\") + \n tm_basemap(server = \"OpenStreetMap\", alpha = 0.7) +\n tm_graticules() +\n tm_title(text = \"Median Income by Census Tract for Houses\n          Affected by the Blackout in Houston\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map reveals the spatial distribution of median household income across census tracts affected by the blackout. The darker red areas indicate higher-income neighborhoods, while lighter shades represent lower-income areas.\nTo quantify whether income played a role in blackout vulnerability, I compared all Houston census tracts, categorizing them by whether they experienced blackouts or not.\nFind census tracts that did not experience blackout\n\n\nCode\n# Compare all Houston tracts against those identified with blackouts,\n# Remove geometry and select only income and status variables\ncensus_combined &lt;- houston_income %&gt;%\n  mutate(blackout_status = if_else(GEOID_Data %in% homes_census_blackout$GEOID_Data, \n                                   \"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(B19013e1, blackout_status) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\nVisualize the distribution of median household income across census tracts to determine if the blackout disproportionately impacted certain socioeconomic groups.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot income distribution by blackout status\nggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(data = census_combined,\n           aes(x = blackout_status, \n               y = B19013e1,\n               fill = blackout_status)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c(\"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#2955AA\", \"#F9cF66\"),\n                    name = \"Blackout Status\") +\n  labs(x = \"Affected Status\",\n       y = \"Median Income of Census Tract\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Median Income in Areas Affected \n       and Unaffected by Blackout in Houston\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot reveals similar income distributions between areas that experienced blackouts and those that did not.
