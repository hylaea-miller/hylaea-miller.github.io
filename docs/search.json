In the Palisades fire perimeter, there is a higher concentration of census tracts with elevated percentiles of elderly residents compared to the Eaton fire perimeter. This suggests that the Palisades area have a larger proportion of older adults who could face greater challenges during wildfire events, such as mobility issues and health vulnerabilities. Consequently, wildfire relief efforts in the Palisades area may need to prioritize resources for evacuation assistance, medical support, and community outreach tailored to the needs of elderly residents. In contrast, the Eaton fire perimeter may require different strategies focused on other demographic factors present in that area.\n\nReferences:\nMicrosoft Planetary Computer. (2025).
