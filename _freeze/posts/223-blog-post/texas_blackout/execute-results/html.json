In February 2021, Texas experienced a major power crisis resulting from three severe winter storms that swept across the United States between February 10-20, leaving millions without power for days in freezing temperatures[^1].\n\nIn this blog post, I identify the impacts of these series of extreme winter storms by estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power and investigate whether these impacts were disproportionately felt by low-income populations.\n\n[^1]: 2021 Texas Power Grid Failure – a preventable disaster.

Houston is included in two tiles: h08v05 and h08v06. We accessed tiles through NASA’s [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)\n\n**ROADS DATA**\n\nOpenStreetMap highway data for Texas, accessed via [Geofabrik’s](https://download.geofabrik.de/) download site, was used to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas, and a Geopackage (.gpkg file) was prepared containing only the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n**BUILDING DATA**\n\nOpenStreetMap building data for Texas, accessed via [Geofabrik’s](https://download.geofabrik.de/) download site, was used to retrieve a shapefile of all houses in Texas, and a Geopackage (.gpkg file) was prepared containing only the subset of houses that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n**SOCIOECONOMIC DATA** \n\nFrom the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019, which contains social, economic, housing, and demographic information across the 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The dataset can be found here: [Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)\n\n\n## Analysis\n\nTo investigate the impact of the February 2021 winter storms on Houston, I analyzed satellite imagery and socioeconomic data through three main steps: identifying blackout locations, estimating affected homes, and examining socioeconomic patterns.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Blackout Locations\nI began by comparing nighttime light intensity before and after the storm using NASA's satellite data. \n\nLoad Packages and Import the datasets\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(raster) \nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\n# Read raster tiles for both dates\nrt_0705 <- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\",\n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\nrt_0706 <- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\nrt_1605 <- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\nrt_1606 <- read_stars(here(\"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \n                           \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n\n# Read roads data\nroads <- st_read(here(\"data\",\n       \"gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\") %>% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Read building data\nbuildings <- st_read(here(\"data\",\n                          \"gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\"),\n  query = \" SELECT *\n    FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1\n    WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)\n      OR type IN ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', \n  'detached')\")\n\n# Read the layers holding the Texas geometry information\ntexas_geom <- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\n\ntexas_income <- st_read(here(\"data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"),\n                         layer = \"X19_INCOME\",\n                         query = \"SELECT B19013e1, GEOID FROM X19_INCOME\") %>%\n  mutate(GEOID_Data = GEOID)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Visualization of Night Light Changes\n\nMaps comparing night light intensities before and after the storms\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Merge tiles from February 7, 2021\nmosaic_7 <- st_mosaic(rt_0705, rt_0706)\n# Merge tiles from February 16, 2021\nmosaic_16 <- st_mosaic(rt_1605, rt_1606)\n\n# Create color palette for the night lights\npal_lights <- c(\"#000011\", \"#000066\", \"#2222AA\", \"#FFFF66\", \"#FFFFFF\")\n\n# Plot raster of night lights before the storms\nmap_before <- tm_shape(mosaic_7) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 07, 2021 (Before storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules()+\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\n# Plot raster of night lights after the storms\nmap_after <- tm_shape(mosaic_16) +\n  tm_raster(palette = pal_lights,\n            style = \"quantile\", \n            title = \"Light Intensity(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Night Lights\\nFebruary 16, 2021 (After storm)\", size = 0.7)+\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),\n            component.autoscale = FALSE,\n            legend.text.size = 0.5,\n            legend.title.size = 0.5,)\n\ntmap_arrange(map_before, map_after, nrow = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](texas_blackout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo isolate areas that truly experienced blackouts, I calculated the change in light intensity between these dates.

To explore this, I overlaid the blackout data with census tract information, examining median household income across affected and unaffected areas.\n\nPrepare median income data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Left join geometry and median income layers\ninc_geom <- left_join(texas_geom, texas_income, by = \"GEOID_Data\") %>% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Transform CRS\nhouston_bbox <- houston_bbox %>% \n  st_transform(crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n\n# Crop income layer to the Houston bounding box\nhouston_income <- st_crop(inc_geom, houston_bbox) %>% \nst_make_valid() %>% \n  st_transform(houston_income, crs = \"epsg:3083\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nMap of the census tracts in Houston that lost power\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Verify that both datasets use the same CRS and add a stop error if they don't\nif(st_crs(houston_income) != st_crs(homes_blackout)){\n    stop(\"coordinate reference systems must match to join datasets\")}\n\n# Intersect census tracts with blackout areas\nhomes_census_blackout <- houston_income[homes_blackout,\n                               op = st_intersects]\n\n# Create map showing median income for blackout-affected census tracts\ntm_shape(homes_census_blackout) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"B19013e1\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",              \n    title = \"Median Income\") + \n tm_basemap(server = \"OpenStreetMap\", alpha = 0.7) +\n tm_graticules() +\n tm_title(text = \"Median Income by Census Tract for Houses\n          Affected by the Blackout in Houston\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](texas_blackout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe map reveals the spatial distribution of median household income across census tracts affected by the blackout. The darker red areas indicate higher-income neighborhoods, while lighter shades represent lower-income areas.\n\nTo quantify whether income played a role in blackout vulnerability, I compared all Houston census tracts, categorizing them by whether they experienced blackouts or not.\n\nFind census tracts that did not experience blackout\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compare all Houston tracts against those identified with blackouts,\n# Remove geometry and select only income and status variables\ncensus_combined <- houston_income %>%\n  mutate(blackout_status = if_else(GEOID_Data %in% homes_census_blackout$GEOID_Data, \n                                   \"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  dplyr::select(B19013e1, blackout_status) %>%\n  drop_na()\n```\n:::\n\n\nVisualize the distribution of median household income across census tracts to determine if the blackout disproportionately impacted certain socioeconomic groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot income distribution by blackout status\nggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(data = census_combined,\n           aes(x = blackout_status, \n               y = B19013e1,\n               fill = blackout_status)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c(\"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#2955AA\", \"#F9cF66\"),\n                    name = \"Blackout Status\") +\n  labs(x = \"Affected Status\",\n       y = \"Median Income of Census Tract\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Median Income in Areas Affected \n       and Unaffected by Blackout in Houston\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](texas_blackout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe boxplot reveals similar income distributions between areas that experienced blackouts and those that did not. The yellow box representing unaffected areas shows a slightly lower median income compared to the blue box representing blackout-affected census tracts.\n\n\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe results show that median household incomes are similar between census tracts that experienced blackouts and those that did not, suggesting that income level was not a strong factor in determining which areas lost power during the storm. However, we need to consider some limitations of this result, as they relate to the spatial scale and join methods used in our analysis. Some possible bias in the results may be related to the concentration of buildings in the central part of Houston affected by blackouts, as shown in the Homes Map, and the reliance on tract-level overlaps that generalize patterns and hide smaller spatial or demographic variations.\n\nFuture research should employ finer spatial resolution (e.g., block group or individual building level) and could incorporate additional socioeconomic variables beyond income, including housing age, renter vs. owner occupancy, and racial demographics.\n\n## References\n\nHome - LAADS DAAC.
