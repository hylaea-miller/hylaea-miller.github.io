:::{.narrative-col}

My path in environmental science began in Brasília and brought me to UC Santa Barbara's Bren School.

[My journey started at the University of Brasília (UnB)]{.focus-text}, where I earned my Bachelor's in Environmental Science from 2020 to 2024.

[During my undergraduate years]{.focus-text}, I discovered my passion for geospatial analysis and remote sensing.

[In 2025, I joined the Master's program]{.focus-text} in Environmental Data Science at UCSB's Bren School.

### PIBIC Research

**Sep 2023 - Aug 2024**

University of Brasília

*Satellite Rainfall Data Accuracy in Central Brazil*
:::
:::

:::{.narrative-col}

[My PIBIC research project]{.focus-text} evaluated satellite rainfall data accuracy in Central Brazil.

[This work involved]{.focus-text} extracting data from multiple satellite sources and performing statistical analyses.

[The findings]{.focus-text} helped assess which satellite products are most reliable for the Cerrado region.
